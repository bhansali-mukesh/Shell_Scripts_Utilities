3. File Utilities ( Creating Map From Properties Files etc. )
4. User Input ( Waits for user Inputs )
5. Kubernetes Helper 
	a. Find Right Context from Multiple Kubernetes Objects for your Resource
	b. Get Resource Details from Kubernetes and Responds to you
	c. Parses Your Resources into Multiple Part and Provide Meaning
	d. Update Your Context with Needed Details like Authentication etc.
6. Create/Refresh Authentication as and when Needed Automatically
7. Intercept Command for Pre-Processing and Fire with Added things
8. Format, UnFormat, Color and re-Direct Text Based on Requirement
